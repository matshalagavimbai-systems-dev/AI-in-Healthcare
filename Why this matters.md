This project matters because it touches a problem that affects almost everyone: how to use powerful AI tools in healthcare without sacrificing trust, safety, or dignity.

When health data is used well, AI can help detect disease earlier, reduce burnout for clinicians, and improve care for patients who are often overlooked. But if privacy and HIPAA requirements are ignored, the same tools can expose sensitive details, widen inequities, and erode public confidence in digital health.

By working through applied HIPAA and data‑privacy concepts step by step, this project aims to create practical patterns that others can reuse. That includes engineers, data scientists, clinicians, and small teams who don’t have a full legal department or robust resources but still want to “do the right thing” with patient data.

In other words, it’s not just a personal learning exercise; it’s a small contribution toward a future where AI in healthcare is not only innovative, but also privacy‑preserving, compliant, and worthy of patients’ trust.
